# Sunsama Infinite Horizontal Swiper

A highly efficient infinite horizontal swiper component designed for the Sunsama mobile app. This library enables smooth, responsive swiping through items (cards) with a natural gesture-based experience.

Note: This README is generated by AI.

## Features

- **Infinite swiping:** Enjoy endlessly scrolling through items.
- **Spring-based animation:** Smooth and natural motion using a physics simulation.
- **Custom rendering:** Render cards with a custom function that supports a focused state.
- **Callback support:** Respond to index changes with worklet callbacks.
- **Imperative control:** Programmatically scroll to a specific index using exposed methods.

## Installation

Install the package via npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install @sunsama/infinite-horizontal-swiper
```

Or:

```bash
yarn add @sunsama/infinite-horizontal-swiper
```

## Requirements

It might work on any other Reanimated/Gesture Handler version, but it is only tested on the following versions:

- React Native >= 0.79.2
- React Native Reanimated >= 3.17.5
- React Native Gesture Handler >= 2.25.0

## Usage

Check out the app in the `example` folder for a working demo. The example app demonstrates how to use the `InfiniteHorizontalSwiper` component in a React Native application.

### Props

| Prop                    | Type                                               | Description                                                                                                                              | Default |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| `renderItem`            | `(index: number, isFocused: boolean) => ReactNode` | A function to render each card. It receives the index of the card and a flag indicating whether the card is focused.                     | —       |
| `windowSize`            | `number`                                           | Number of cards to display at once. Must be an odd number greater than 1. Adjusting this can help balance performance and UI smoothness. | `3`     |
| `onIndexChangedWorklet` | `(index: number) => void`                          | A Reanimated worklet function called when the index changes. Use this callback to respond to changes in focus.                           | —       |

### Reference Methods

After attaching a ref to the component (using `React.forwardRef`), the following method is available:

#### `scrollToIndex`

```typescript
scrollToIndex: (index: number) => void;
```

Programmatically scrolls the swiper to focus the card at the specified index with a smooth spring animation.
